# Writeups

A place for me to upload any writeups I do for TryHackMe rooms and HackTheBox machines. All notes are taken with Obsidian, which fits well in GitHub since GitHub also uses markdown.

TryHackMe writeups:
- [CC-pentesting room](https://github.com/gsujan1/writeups/blob/main/CC-pentesting/WRITEUP.md)
